## Motivation
I recently started studying Rust and decided to try rewrite [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) (which are in TypeScript) 
as an 
experiment.

The main idea was not only rewriting Redux and learn Rust more, but also I was wondering is it possible
to save the same syntax and port it to the Web Assembly
